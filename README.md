## Developer & Technical Writer
I build tools that solve real problems people actually have. When I encounter workflow friction, I don't just work around it - I build elegant solutions that turn painful tasks into delightful experiences.
**Basically, I notice what's broken and ship fixes that make everyone's life better.**

### ðŸ§  How I Work

- User-driven development: I build tools to solve problems I personally experience, ensuring they address real workflow friction rather than theoretical requirements.
- First-principles problem solving: I don't assume limitations are permanent until I understand why they exist. This led me to solve Unix's 50-year directory inheritance problem - not because I knew it was impossible, but because I needed cd to work in command chains.
- Rapid execution mindset: I leverage technical skills to move quickly from idea to working software, enabling fast iteration based on actual usage patterns.

## Project Highlights:

- [autocd-go](https://github.com/codinganovel/autocd-go) - Cross-platform library solving 50-year Unix directory inheritance limitation via process replacement
- [mkmd](https://github.com/codinganovel/mkmd) - Terminal text editor with chunking for large files and horizontal scrolling
- [ql](https://github.com/codinganovel/ql) - Interactive command launcher with fuzzy search and template system
- [yanked](https://github.com/codinganovel/yanked) - Universal package manager for GitHub-hosted tools
- [cdf](https://github.com/codinganovel/cdf) - Directory-only fuzzy finder with autocd integration - faster than file-based alternatives

Plus 20+ additional tools, each with comprehensive README files and usage documentation.

## ðŸ›  Technical Focus

- **Development:** Go (systems tools), Python (rapid prototyping), cross-platform compatibility
- **Background:** Film/TV degree + 10+ years programming experience
- **Unique Combination:** Technical depth with clear communication skills

## ðŸŒŸ What Makes Me Different

> I'm the builder you want when you need tools that actually solve problems. I excel at:

- Identifying real user pain points through firsthand experience
- Building complete solutions from concept to working software
- Creating tools that work together as coherent ecosystems
- Moving fast from idea to production-quality code

I approach development like a user advocate with the technical skills to actually ship solutions.
